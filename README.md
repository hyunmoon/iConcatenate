## What is this?
It is a simple tool that lets you quickly concatenate image files.

## How do I run it?
see [Autohotkey.com](http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/86134-autohotkey-10-classic-and-basic-versions/)  

First, download this repo as zip file and unzip it.  
After that, there are two ways you can run it. You can just run the compiled script (iConcatenate.exe) or you can install Autohotkey software (version 1.0.48.05) and run iConcatenate.ahk script with it. Make sure to place convert.exe and the script in the same directory.

## Usage
First, you will want to **rename** the images because they will be concatenated in **alphabetical order**.

Second, **choose** which way the images should be concatenated (vertical or horizontal)

Now, you have two options:

1. You can **Drag and drop** the images into the interface or

2. You can click on Select, choose images and click on Save.

## Image format
When you're **saving**, if you **do not** write the file name **extension**,  
the image will be created in **PNG** format. If you would like it in other formats like jpeg, you should make sure to **write .jpg at the end** of the file name.

## Disclosure
This script is only a **GUI wrapper** for **ImageMagick** software. ImageMagick is a great software to process images but I thought its command-line interface is a bit difficult to use so I wrote this script to make it easier to use.
